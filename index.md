# About the website

The website itself is hosted on Github Pages, and is automatically generated from the code in [the Github repository](https://github.com/oliversutton/testblog).

# What can be written

There are two three types of pages: static pages (linked along the top), blog posts, and pages dedicated to specific people (linked as authors of blog posts, or from the 'People' page at the top).

Most importantly, pages can include typeset maths: $P(x \sim \mathcal{U}(\mathbb{B}_d) : \\| x \\| < r) = 1 - r^d$ just by typing the Latex `$P(x \sim \mathcal{U}(\mathbb{B}_d) : \\| x \\| < r) = 1 - r^d$`.
For further examples of what sorts of content can be included, [see the dedicated blog post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2023-03-25-some-things-we-can-include %}).
